# ReactJs-Proj

**Useful Tools**

- NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/
- ReactJS https://reactjs.org/
- BabelJS https://babeljs.io/
- web3JS https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/

**NodeJS**

A basic NodeJS server file is included in the main directory /CryptoPage/server.js
This server is for testing web functionality only.
In the future this will be re-done to utilize SSL as well as session cookies

To run the server use the commandline:
 - node server.js

Note that this server runs on port 8000

**Notes**

Certain files are still in the blocking/testing stage, these files include

- Index.html
	Homepage for the website, still using background-color to properly block out containers, should be optimized for mobile.
- .cryptoBox
	As of this point, the CryptoBox containers still are manually added, in the future they will be added dynamically based on reactJS, this could also allow new boxes to be added OTF, each box currently only requires: An Image, A Name, A URL
